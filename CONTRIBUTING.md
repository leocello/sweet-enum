# Contributing

Contributions are welcome, and are accepted via pull requests. Also please feel free to drop any problems found under issues tab.

## Process

- Fork the project
- Create a new branch
- Code, test, lint, commit and push

## Tests

`SweatEnum` uses [pestphp/pest](https://github.com/pestphp/pest). So please check their documentation in case you are not familiar with it.

To run the tests, there is a composer script to make it easier. So you can just run:

```shell
composer test
```

## Lint

`SweatEnum` uses [laravel/pint](https://github.com/laravel/pint) to keep the code readable. So make sure you run it before placing a pull request.

Same as tests, there is a composer script to make it easier. So just run:

```shell
composer lint
```
